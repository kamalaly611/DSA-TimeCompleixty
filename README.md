### 1️⃣ Measuring Execution Time (⚠️ Not Recommended)
- Using `time.time()` to measure execution time.
- Why it's **not reliable** due to varying machine specs.

### 2️⃣ Iterative vs Recursive Algorithms
- Countdown using `while` loop.
- Factorial function **O(n) complexity** (Iterative vs Recursive).

### 3️⃣ String Conversion (Integer to String)
- Understanding how integers are converted to strings manually.

### 4️⃣ Nested Loops & Pair Generation
- **O(n²) complexity**: Generating pairs in a list.
- **O(n × m) complexity**: Comparing two lists element-wise.

### 5️⃣ Triple Nested Loops
- Understanding how **O(n³)** complexity arises.

### 6️⃣ Swapping Elements in a List
- Optimized **O(n)** approach to reverse a list in-place.

### 7️⃣ Fibonacci Sequence (Exponential Complexity 🚨)
- **O(2ⁿ) complexity**: Why recursive Fibonacci is inefficient.
